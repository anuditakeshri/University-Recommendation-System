## University Recommendation System
<p>University College education plays an important role in a
studentâ€™s life. Hence, choosing the right college for the right
student is a highly challenging task. Although many
universities have adapted to centralized admissions, the
system is not efficient and a lot of time is spent in securing an
admission in the institutes. This is primarily due to large
number of applications being submitted to universities every
year. </p>
<p>Recommender Systems are data filtering mechanisms 
which focus on overload of information and filter out
relevant chunks of data according to user preferences. Such
systems have the ability to predict if a user may be interested
in certain items based on their profile. </p>

<p>I have built a recommendation system of my own. Since data was not readily available, I scraped data Edulix.com.
The CSV file is present here named "allUsersFinal.csv". The file is present in .ipynb format.</p>
